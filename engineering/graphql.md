# GraphQL

* [GraphQL Mesh](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh) – Easy way to create API Gateways out of different APIs. For example: You can specify an OpenAPI Spec file and the corresponding API will be integrated into the schema of the GraphQL API.
* [graphql-middleware](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-middleware) – Allows the definition of functions which gets executed before / after a resolver has been executed. Pretty handy for auth validation and data transformation.
